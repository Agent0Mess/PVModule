# PVModule
Important note: This is a work in progress. Most of the code is not working at this stage.

PVModule is a small library written in C++ to calculate the position of the sun at a given time and in a given location,
in order to align a solar panel respectively.

The code is designed to run on a microcontroller like the Arduino Uno (i.e. ATmega328P) but should work on other platforms too.
